# LLM-Powered Text Analysis App

Welcome to the LLM-Powered Text Analysis App! This Streamlit application leverages advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models to provide interactive question answering and text summarization features.

## Features

1. **Question Answering**: Use a question-answering model to get precise answers from a given context. The model used is available at [Ferreus/QA_model](https://huggingface.co/Ferreus/QA_model).
2. **Text Summarization**:
   - **Word Count Frequency**: Summarize text based on the frequency of word occurrence. Explore the implementation in the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zl4PkmlL3GhrBAWnkBLPbNjDkRkX_J33).
   - **TextRank Algorithm**: Summarize text using the TextRank algorithm for ranking sentences. You can explore the implementation of TextRank in the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kUNIPMYyJVYXZoiV9ZKyFX_p-1n9jS0s#scrollTo=dcSxVJ8wRXtP).

## Demo

## Usage

1. **Question Answering**:
   - Enter a context in the provided text area.
   - Ask a question related to the context.
   - Get the answer generated by the model.

2. **Text Summarization**:
   - Provide the text you want to summarize.
   - Choose the number of sentences you want in the summary.
   - Select a summarization method:
     - **Word Count Frequency**: This method summarizes text based on word frequency and displays a word cloud.
     - **TextRank Algorithm**: This method summarizes text using the TextRank algorithm and visualizes sentence similarity and ranking.
